  description:
In the moment - You see someone at a party getting pressured to drink more alcohol after they've said no. You could distract by

Changing the subject - "Hey, has anyone tried the snacks over there?"
Physically interrupting - Gently pulling the person away and saying, "Come with me, I want to show you something."
Creating a diversion - "Oh, the music just changed! This is my jam!" and starting to dance.

In the moment - During a meeting, someone makes a biased remark. You could distract by

Asking a question related to the task at hand to shift the focus.
Saying, "Let's get back to the agenda."

  description:
You witness a situation that feels unsafe or beyond your comfort level to handle directly. You could delegate by

Finding someone in a position of authority (e.g., manager, RA, security personnel) and reporting what you've seen. "Excuse me, I just saw [describe the situation], and I'm concerned. Could you please help?"

Asking a group of other bystanders to help. "Hey, I think [person] might need some help. Could a few of us check in?"

Contacting a specific resource, like campus security or a hotline.

  description:
Whether you intervene directly or not, documenting what you observed can be helpful
Writing down the date, time, location, and a detailed account of what you saw and heard.

If you feel comfortable, you could offer your documentation to the person who was harmed, as it might be helpful if they choose to report the incident.

Saving any relevant messages or evidence (if appropriate and safe to do so).

It's important to remember that the best approach depends on the specific situation, your comfort level, and your safety.

Sometimes a combination of these strategies can be most effective.

  description:
You witness or become aware of an incident after it has occurred. You can still delay your intervention by Checking in with the person who was harmed
"Hey, I heard what happened earlier. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to support you?"

Offering resources and support - "There are resources available if you want to talk to someone about what happened."

Reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities or channels after the fact.

Speaking to the person who caused harm later, if you feel safe and it's appropriate- "I heard about what happened earlier, and I wanted to say that kind of behavior isn't okay."

  topic: What to do to Direct
  description:In the moment:
You witness someone making a sexually suggestive comment to a colleague that makes them visibly uncomfortable. You could directly intervene by saying

"Hey, that's not appropriate."
"Can we please keep the conversation professional?"
"I don't think that comment was necessary."

To the person being targeted - "Are you okay?"

After the incident - You see someone being excluded from a group conversation with microaggressions.

You could directly address the behavior later by saying to the person who was excluding
"I noticed that [person's name] seemed left out of the conversation earlier. Maybe we can be more mindful of including everyone."
