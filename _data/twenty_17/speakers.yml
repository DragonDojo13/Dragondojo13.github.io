  topic: What to do to Distract
  description: In the moment: You witness someone making a sexually suggestive comment to a colleague that makes them visibly uncomfortable. You could directly intervene by saying:
"Hey, that's not appropriate."
"Can we please keep the conversation professional?"
"I don't think that comment was necessary."
To the person being targeted: "Are you okay?"
After the incident: You see someone being excluded from a group conversation with microaggressions. You could directly address the behavior later by saying to the person who was excluding:
"I noticed that [person's name] seemed left out of the conversation earlier. Maybe we can be more mindful of including everyone."
