  topic: What to do to Distract
  description: "You notice a student or person repeatedly making unwanted comments to another person disrupting their work/activity and making them visibly upset.
  what to do: Interrupt the behavior by changing the focus: "Hey, did you see the homework assignment for next week?" or "Excuse me, do you know what page we're on?"
  You could also "accidentally" drop something, ask a question to the group, or create a reason for the person causing harm to turn their attention elsewhere.
  The goal is to temporarily stop the harmful behavior"

  description: "You witness a group of students/people ganging up on another person during lunch, making rude comments and laughing at them. You don't feel comfortable directly confronting the group on your own.
  What do do: Take the initiative to find help. Find a teacher, counselor, school administrator, co worker, or another trusted adult and explain what you are seeing. Clearly describe what is happening, where, and who is involved."

  topic: What to do to Document
  description: " You are witnessing persistent bullying behavior happening in a common area. You've tried other methods, or you believe having a record of the incidents would be helpful for reporting.
  what to do: If it feels safe to do so, and if school policy allows, discreetly record or take notes on what you are seeing and hearing. Stick to recording what you observe without adding your opinions or interpretations.
  Provide the information you've gathered to a teacher, counselor, or administrator to support their intervention. Only document if it feels safe and doesn't put yourself or others at further risk."

  description: " You witness a situation that made you uncomfortable, but you didn't feel safe or able to intervene in the moment. Perhaps you saw someone being excluded or heard a hurtful joke directed at someone after class or a work meeting.
  what to do: Check in with the person who was harmed later. Offer support: Listen to them, validate their feelings, and offer help or resources if appropriate (e.g., "Do you want to talk to a counselor?").
  Report the incident if necessary"

  topic: What to do to Direct
  description: "You see two students/people in the hallway. One person is standing very close to the other speaking loudly and pointing their finger agressively. The other person looks uncomfortable and is trying to back away.
  What to do: Directly address the situation "Hey, everything okay here?" or "Excuse me, can you give them some space?" Focus on the behavior, not the person. Be claer and concise, and prioritize safety"
