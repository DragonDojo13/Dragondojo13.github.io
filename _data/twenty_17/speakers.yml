  description:In the moment:
You witness someone making a sexually suggestive comment to a colleague that makes them visibly uncomfortable. You could directly intervene by saying

"Hey, that's not appropriate."
"Can we please keep the conversation professional?"
"I don't think that comment was necessary."

To the person being targeted - "Are you okay?"

After the incident - You see someone being excluded from a group conversation with microaggressions.

You could directly address the behavior later by saying to the person who was excluding
"I noticed that [person's name] seemed left out of the conversation earlier. Maybe we can be more mindful of including everyone."
